        My name is Omar, and I am a full-stack software engineer with 5 years of experience building production systems — from IoT device APIs and real-time data pipelines to full-scale ERP platforms. I work across the stack with Angular, React, Node.js, and Express, and I'm expanding into Python. I'm passionate about architecting reliable, scalable systems and solving the hard problems that live behind the interface.

            Designed and developed a fullstack Jira-like task management system
            web app. Built the frontend using React and TypeScript, enabling
            users to create multiple projects. Within each project, users can
            add customizable columns to represent task statuses and create tasks
            with specific details. Implemented a drag-and-drop interface
            allowing users to move tasks between columns to update their status.
            Developed the backend in Go with efficient CRUD APIs to manage
            project data, columns, and tasks. Integrated MongoDB for data
            storage and retrieval, ensuring high performance and data
            persistence.
